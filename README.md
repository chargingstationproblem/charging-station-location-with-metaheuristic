**Multi-Objective Optimization for EV Charging Station Planning
**Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a multi-objective optimization model for electric vehicle (EV) charging station planning. The model integrates drivers' preferences and fairness considerations to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of EV charging networks. It includes a heuristic approach combining machine learning for demand clustering and NSGA-II with a custom selection operator for multi-objective optimization.

Key Features
Multi-objective optimization: Maximizes network utility while minimizing drivers' travel and waiting times.
Fairness considerations: Ensures equitable access to charging facilities.
Machine learning integration: Uses clustering algorithms (K-Means, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Model) to identify potential charging station locations.
Heuristic optimization: Implements HNSGA-II with a custom selection operator combining RWS and BTS for improved solution quality.
